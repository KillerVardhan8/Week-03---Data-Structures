## Overview
This week covered how to handle runtime errors gracefully using exceptions and explored core data structures provided by Java’s Collection Framework. You'll gain the ability to build error-resilient and data-driven applications.

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: Exception Handling Basics
- What are exceptions?  
- Types: Checked vs. Unchecked  
- `try` and `catch` blocks  

### Day 2: Try-Catch-Finally and Nested Blocks
- Multiple `catch` blocks  
- Nested `try` blocks  
- The `finally` block  

### Day 3: Custom Exceptions
- Creating user-defined exceptions  
- Throwing and catching custom exceptions  
- Use of `throw` and `throws`  

### Day 4: Introduction to Collections
- Why use collections?  
- Collection hierarchy  
- Generics in collections  

### Day 5: List Interface - ArrayList and LinkedList
- Creating and modifying lists  
- Iterating through lists  
- Difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`  

### Day 6: Set Interface - HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
- Uniqueness in sets  
- Ordering and performance comparison  
- Working with custom objects in sets  

## Prerequisites
- JDK installed  
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code)  
- Basic knowledge of OOP and Java syntax (Weeks 1 & 2)
